			<p>
				I started coding back in 2018 in class 11th when i took my optional subject as IP(Information practices)
				in which i learned java and dbms till 2020, made few projects too. 
				Initially it was very tough for me, i hardly attended any lectures of java, because mostly i was absent and in exams i used to face problem,
				this particular subject required attention and time compared to Physical education and i was busy most of the time in jee prep, 
				so didn't pay that much attention, but any how i knew and i learned many concepts very well of dbms to java connection using jdbc, made an hospital management system all by myself 
				with help of my teacher, good old days and i also performed very well on the day of viva 
				Computer subject was there from class 4th only, i didn't had any pc at home but most of the stuff i learned through school pc's only 
				like word, excel, drawing etc etc ...
